This paper explores the application of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for identifying dynamic market regimes and improving portfolio allocation strategies. Using Fama-French factor data, the thesis first selects an optimal HMM based on information criteria and then applies it within a backtesting framework with walk-forward validation. Two HMM strategies (single-step and multi-step) are developed to generate estimates of expected returns and covariances for Mean-Variance optimization. The performance of these strategies is compared against traditional MVO and 1/N benchmark portfolios. The results show that while the HMM does not achieve high accuracy in predicting the direction or amplitude of returns, the multi-step HMM strategy consistently achieves statistically significantly higher Sharpe ratios. The HMM approach provides value primarily through superior regime-conditioned risk estimation, rather than return prediction, making it an effective tool for dynamic portfolio management.
